# Algorithm Visualizer for Demonstrating and Comparing Algorithms and Data Structures

## <a href="https://algolizer.anasouardini.online" target="_blank">Check It Live</a>

Algolizer is an algorithm visualizer project that highlights the differences in performance between each algorithm and data structure (DS).

When I first learned about algorithms and data structures, I thought there was an ultimate best and worst algorithm/DS. It turns out it's more complicated than that. Each algorithm and/or DS has its own use case, which you might or might not be able to identify until you're in the middle of a project.

## My Motive

Since this is not a straightforward process, I thought, "Why not illustrate this through a project where I can gain a better understanding of these tools?" It can also serve as a tool to help others understand that it's not a black-and-white situation, but a combination of many variables, some of which we can't even know until we dive in. It's not always about the number of CPU cycles or the memory footprint. Sometimes, the fastest to write and easiest to maintain is the sweet spot.

However, this project might not be the best introduction to the world of algorithms and DS, as it does not demonstrate all the different aspects of the subject. But it's meant as a stepping stone on my web development roadmap and a project to include in my portfolio.
