# Algorithm visualizer for demonstrating and comparing algorithms and data structues

Algolizer is an algorithms visualizer project, which highlights the difference in performance between each algorithm and data structure (DS).

When I first learned Algorithms and data structures, I was always thinking that there is an ultimate best and worst algorithm/DS, It turns out it more complicated than that: each algorith and/or DS has its own usecase which you might or might not be able to identify in the first place untill you're in the middle of project.

# My motive

Since this is not straight forward idea, I though why not illustrate this thorugh a project where I can gain a better understanding of theses tools, and also use it to help others understand that it's not a black and while situation but a combination of many variables, some of which we can't even know before we dive in.

However, this project might not be the best intro to the world of algorithms and DS, But it's first meant as a step of my web development roadmap and a project to put on my portfolio.
